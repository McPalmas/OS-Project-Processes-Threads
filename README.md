# Frog Crossing Game

This project is an implementation of the classic "Frog Crossing" game in C, developed for the Operating Systems course. 

Two versions were implemented:
1. **Process-based version** – uses multiple processes to simulate the game elements concurrently.
2. **Thread-based version** – uses threads for concurrent execution, demonstrating synchronization techniques.
